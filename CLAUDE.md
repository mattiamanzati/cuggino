# Project Structure

## `.repos/` - Source Repositories

This folder contains cloned source repositories for reference. Use these to search for patterns, implementation details, and real-world examples.

Before making assumptions based on pre-trained knowledge, search within these repositories for accurate and up-to-date implementation details.

## `.patterns/` - Pattern Documentation

This folder contains documented patterns and best practices extracted from the source repositories.

Before writing code, consult these patterns and the enstablished code to ensure you're following the correct conventions and approaches rather than relying on pre-trained assumptions.

## `.specs/` - Project Specifications

This folder contains the specifications for what we are building. Read these to understand the project requirements and architecture.

# Writing Style

## Specs

Specs should focus on the desired outcome, user experience, and expected behavior — not on code or implementation details. The implementation is left to the code. Do not include code examples unless the user explicitly asks to pin down a specific interface or data shape.

## Backlog Items

Backlog items should describe the expected outcome and behavior, not prescribe code or implementation approach. Only include code examples when the user explicitly requests a specific interface or shape. If not explicitly requested, omit code from backlog items.

## Effect Language Service

The Effect Language Service comes in with a useful CLI that can help you with commands to get a better understanding your Effect Layers and Services, and to help you compose them correctly.
