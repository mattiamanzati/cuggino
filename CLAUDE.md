# Project Structure

## `.repos/` - Source Repositories

This folder contains cloned source repositories for reference. Use these to search for patterns, implementation details, and real-world examples.

Before making assumptions based on pre-trained knowledge, search within these repositories for accurate and up-to-date implementation details.

## `.patterns/` - Pattern Documentation

This folder contains documented patterns and best practices extracted from the source repositories.

Before writing code, consult these patterns and the enstablished code to ensure you're following the correct conventions and approaches rather than relying on pre-trained assumptions.

## `.specs/` - Project Specifications

This folder contains the specifications for what we are building. Read these to understand the project requirements and architecture.
